        <p class="lead mb-4">Whenever I see an opportunity to experience something from a different perspective, I tend to stray towards it for a unique experience. Observing what might become of us from that outcome will magnetize me in a way to pursue it. I believe that becoming an employee of this company will in many ways help me develop not only as a student but also as a leader; to become the forefront of what a member of staff embodies, a person of uplifting spirit, a person of good character, and a person of comprehension. My personal position regarding the substance of oneself includes the prioritization of oneself in a healthy and true manner. To be noble in the aspect where you are being superior to your former self in any category. I always like to maximize the scope of my potential in my professions by giving it all to the team effort, the way I see it if my team wins, I win. When it comes to academics, I tend to indulge in the learning realm because of the vast content that there is for me to absorb. The way I see it, is that everyone in one shape or form are students, thereâ€™s never a limit for me because I always have the intention to pursue the path of knowledge.<br><br>

        My values reside by fully committing myself to education, whether it is formal or self-education, the devotion to transpire myself into the best that I can be, and the promotion as well as the assimilation of other cultures and societies. To study the writings of the greatest minds and to discover the tenets that the finest thinkers observed, the more I gained, the more I sought to earn. My mind is set on the development of myself as a person, to be the best that I can be physically, mentally, and socially through the means of philanthropy. Initiating conversations about the cultures of others and treading on the unknown territory of a topic that I donâ€™t know about always piques my interest. These three pillars that uphold my values defines my character and mission.<br><br>

        The most significant change that I have experienced was my perception of the world and myself when I was a senior in high school. As a kid I was the known introvert who was unknown in the classroom. I would talk minimally to others because I was shy and because I saw no need to communicate, I was simply there for school and nothing else. I continued to function in this manner throughout most of my school attendance. There was this element of dissatisfaction from something that I couldnâ€™t quite pinpoint. As I went to high school the same situation occurred where I never participated in anything social. It wasnâ€™t until the very end of my senior year when I discovered that I was blinded by my introvertness. At the time I was looking back at the previous years when I discovered the missing component. The missing component comprised of regret, which before was something I didnâ€™t acknowledge until now. Ninety-five percent of me was the introvert aspect while the rest was my inner extravertness that remained hidden throughout the years. My perspective of the world throughout the years resided in the realm that there was nothing exciting for me as an individual to do because I felt alienated in the social construct. I perceived myself as an outcast, always wondering why other people would even want to interact socially and it always was mind-boggling to me. As the regret caught onto me, I had a newfound interest for the world. My new perception of the world was that the world is a colorful and artistic playground of fascinating experiences that are waiting to be enacted upon. This resulted in the change of perspective for myself because I discovered that life is what you make of it. My newfound perspective of myself was that I was a somebody, more than just another person in the crowd. This propelled me to take action seeing as how I was my own vessel in this masterpiece of a world. Slowly I began to make my way up as an extrovert and out of my shell by getting more involved socially.  It was a relatively smooth transition seeing as how more interesting the world was to me.
